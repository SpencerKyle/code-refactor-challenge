# Code Refactor Challenge

This challenge consisted of cleaning up the html to decrease the clutter in both the index.html file as well as the style.css too.
There were many uneeded classes that were assigned when it could have easily been done by changing <divs> to certain semantic elements.

Alt attributes were added to each image to help for reader access.

Comments were added to both the index.html sheet and also the style.css to better organize what was going on.

A title was added to correctly reflect which page we were viewing, instead of having it blank.
